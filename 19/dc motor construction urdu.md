## Electric DC Motors Direct Current Motor Basics,Types and.
A DC motor is an electric motor that runs on direct current power.In an electric motor,the operation is dependent upon simple electromagnetism.A current carrying conductor generates a magnetic field,when this is then placed in an external magnetic field,it will encounter a force proportional to the current in the conductor and to the strength of the external magnetic field.Servo Motor Basics,Working Principle & TheoryA servo motor is an electrical device which can push or rotate an object with great precision.If you want to rotate and object at some specific angles or distance,then you use servo motor.It is just made up of simple motor which run through servo mechanism.
