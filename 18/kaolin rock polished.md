## PROGRESSIVE STAGES IN THE FORMATION OF KAOLIN.
Halloysite and kaolinite occur in gneissic weathering profiles developed under a temperate climate in the Leucogia area of NE Greece.X ray diffraction analyses of samples from three profiles of partially weathered gneisses have revealed that kaolinite becomes more abundant than halloysite with increasing intensity of the decomposition processes.How Is Garnet Mined & Processed? Our PastimesMiners extract garnets in a number of ways.In open pit mining,workers remove the soil from an area,and then chip the rock out of the ground by hand or with machinery.This method can damage agricultural areas,so miners developed another method in which they dig vertical shafts into the ground,supported by timbers.
